# Blockscout Analysis Skill — Specification

## Purpose

Create a modular AI agent skill for two equally important goals: (1) **blockchain activity analysis** using the Blockscout MCP Server, and (2) **building scripts, tools, and applications** that query blockchain data through the Blockscout MCP Server (native MCP tools and REST API). The skill must guide agents in selecting the right execution strategy — whether to make direct MCP tool calls, write and run a script calling the MCP REST API for deterministic multi-step flows, or use a combination of both.

## Infrastructure Components

### 1. Blockscout MCP Server

- **MCP endpoint**: `https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp` (native MCP protocol)
- **REST API**: `https://mcp.blockscout.com/v1/{tool_name}?params` (HTTP GET)
- **Multichain**: The server is multichain; almost all tools accept a `chain_id` parameter to target a specific chain. Use `get_chains_list` to discover supported chains, always passing its `query` parameter — a case-insensitive substring match by chain name, ecosystem, or native currency — so the call returns only the relevant chains instead of the full registry; fall back to a no-argument call only when a query returns no matches.
- **16 tools**: unlock_blockchain_analysis, get_chains_list, get_address_info, get_address_by_ens_name, get_tokens_by_address, nft_tokens_by_address, get_transactions_by_address, get_token_transfers_by_address, get_block_info, get_block_number, get_transaction_info, get_contract_abi, inspect_contract_code, read_contract, lookup_token_by_symbol, direct_api_call
- **Responses**: LLM-friendly (pre-filtered, enriched), except for `direct_api_call`, which proxies raw Blockscout API responses.
- **`direct_api_call` response size limit**: The MCP server enforces a default response size limit (100,000 characters) on `direct_api_call` responses. When exceeded, a 413 error is returned. Native MCP calls strictly enforce this limit. REST API callers can bypass it by including the `X-Blockscout-Allow-Large-Response: true` HTTP header — but scripts using this bypass must still apply [response transformation](#response-transformation) before passing output to the LLM.
- **Response format equivalence**: Native MCP tool calls and REST API calls to the same tool return identical JSON response structures. When writing scripts that will call the REST API, the agent can use native MCP tool calls to probe and validate the expected response shape. This is especially useful when the agent's runtime environment cannot reach the REST API directly (e.g., network restrictions) but the script will run in an unrestricted environment.
- **Advantage**: Simplified cursor-based pagination more suitable for LLMs and scripts, and guidance in the responses to suggest the next step.

#### Mandatory `unlock_blockchain_analysis` (MCP prerequisite)

- **Rule**: Before any other Blockscout MCP tool call, the agent must call `unlock_blockchain_analysis`. This is a **hard skill-level prerequisite** that applies to every MCP client and every access method (native MCP or REST API), with no exceptions for clients that read server-side instructions reliably.
- **Once per session**: A single successful call at the start of the session covers all subsequent Blockscout MCP tool use in that session. The skill must not instruct the agent to call it before every tool invocation.
- **Rationale**: The skill requires the call as a session prerequisite for any subsequent Blockscout MCP tool use. The server side may eventually enforce this gating at runtime; the skill does not depend on that enforcement existing today, but it does treat the call as required regardless.
- **Skill behavior**: The skill must instruct the agent to call `unlock_blockchain_analysis` once per session (or before the first MCP tool use) whenever the agent decides to use Blockscout MCP tools — independent of the MCP client in use. The skill's wording must make the "once per session" qualifier visible (not buried in prose), so the agent does not misread the rule as "before every call".

#### MCP tool documentation and discovery

- **When MCP is configured**: If the Blockscout MCP server is configured (e.g., `https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp`), tool names and descriptions are already supplied in the agent’s context by the MCP client; the agent may still use the API reference for parameter details.
- **When MCP is not configured**: If the MCP server is not configured, the agent can discover tools and their schemas via the REST list endpoint: `GET https://mcp.blockscout.com/v1/tools`. The skill must instruct the agent to use this URL when tool descriptions are otherwise unavailable.

#### Pagination (MCP): opaque cursor and simplified model

MCP pagination is **simplified** compared to the raw Blockscout API so that agents and scripts don’t have to handle endpoint-specific keys.

- **Detection**: A response carries a `pagination` field iff more pages are available. The presence of this field, not the size of the returned list, is the signal that the agent should keep paginating.
- **Next-call shape**: `pagination.next_call` holds the **complete** next request — the tool name and every required parameter, including the cursor. The skill must instruct the agent to use this shape directly rather than reconstructing the call by hand. A single Base64URL-encoded `cursor` is the only piece of state the agent carries between pages; there are no endpoint-specific query parameters or key names to remember.
- **Access methods**: The skill must cover both native MCP (invoke the tool named in `next_call` with its `params` as-is) and the REST API used by scripts (translate `next_call` into the next HTTP GET, with `cursor` as a `?cursor=...` query parameter).
- **Comprehensive-data behavior**: When the user asks for comprehensive data or "all" results, the skill must instruct the agent to keep following `pagination.next_call` until the data is exhausted or a reasonable limit is reached — not to stop after the first page.

### 2. Supporting Services

#### Chainscout

This is the Blockscout chain registry. It is a separate service from any individual Blockscout instance and is accessed via direct HTTP requests (e.g., WebFetch or curl)—**not** via the `direct_api_call` MCP tool, which does not proxy calls to the Chainscout service.

The primary purpose of Chainscout access is to resolve a chain ID to its Blockscout explorer URL. Chain IDs must first be obtained from the `get_chains_list` MCP tool, which provides the authoritative list of supported chains with their IDs.

## Skill Preparation Phase

There are separate specifications that define preparation to produce API reference files. These reference files become part of the skill documentation (in `references`).

### Blockscout API

The specification is [`blockscout-api-composition-spec.md`](blockscout-api-composition-spec.md). It describes the pipeline to produce comprehensive API reference files in `references/blockscout-api/` and the index file in `references/blockscout-api-index.md`. The agent consults these when it needs to discover endpoints for use with `direct_api_call`.

### Chainscout

The specification is [`chainscout-api-spec.md`](chainscout-api-spec.md). It describes the preparation to produce the API reference file in `references/chainscout-api.md`. The agent consults it when it needs to discover the Blockscout instance URL for a specific chain.

### Claude Code Marketplace Plugin

The specification is [`marketplace-plugin-spec.md`](marketplace-plugin-spec.md). It describes the plugin entry in the Claude Code marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) that declares skill metadata and the Blockscout MCP server dependency. This entry enables Claude Code users to discover and install the skill via `/plugin marketplace add` and automatically configures the MCP server.

## Design Requirements

### Conformance to Agent Skills standard

The skill must conform to the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification.md). The specification defines the directory structure, `SKILL.md` format (frontmatter and body), optional directories (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`), file referencing conventions, and — critically — the **progressive disclosure** model that governs how agents load skill content:

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): `name` and `description` are loaded at startup for all skills.
2. **Instructions** (< 5000 tokens recommended): The full `SKILL.md` body is loaded when the skill is activated.
3. **Resources** (as needed): Files in `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` are loaded only when required — with no guarantee they will be loaded at all.

### SKILL.md self-sufficiency

Because the progressive disclosure model guarantees that only `SKILL.md` is loaded at activation — while reference files may or may not be loaded during execution — `SKILL.md` must be **self-sufficient for correct agent behavior**:

- All instructions the agent needs to follow the right process — workflow phases, decision framework, security rules, disclaimers, response handling rules — must live in `SKILL.md` itself.
- An agent that reads only `SKILL.md` and never opens a reference file must still behave correctly.
- Reference files in `references/` are for **lookup data** the agent consults during task execution (e.g., API endpoint parameters, chain registry details). `SKILL.md` must give the agent a clear reason and trigger to read each reference file, so the agent understands why and when to load it.
- Content must only be moved from `SKILL.md` to `references/` when it is lookup or reference data by nature — not to meet the line budget by offloading behavioral instructions.

### Modular structure

The skill must use a hub-and-spoke pattern:

- `SKILL.md` — concise entry point with decision table (execution strategy) and quick references
- Supporting docs in `references/` — loaded on demand by the agent, one per topic
- API reference files in `references/` — produced during the [skill preparation phase](#skill-preparation-phase)
- **Ad-hoc script dependencies**: The skill must instruct the agent to write ad-hoc scripts using only the standard library of the chosen language and tools already available on the host. The agent must not install packages, create virtual environments, or add package manager files. When a task appears to require a third-party library (e.g., ABI encoding, hashing, address checksumming), the agent must use the corresponding MCP tool instead (e.g., `read_contract`, `get_contract_abi`). If after exhausting standard-library and MCP tool options a third-party package is still genuinely required, the agent may install it, but must clearly state in its output what was installed and why no alternative was viable.

### SKILL.md line budget

Per the [Agent Skills best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices), the `SKILL.md` body (excluding frontmatter) should be kept **under 500 lines**. The modular hub-and-spoke structure supports this: if during skill preparation any content would push `SKILL.md` beyond this budget, **lookup and reference data** (not behavioral instructions) may be moved to a separate file in `references/` and referenced from `SKILL.md`, subject to the [self-sufficiency rule](#skillmd-self-sufficiency). The exact split is determined during the skill preparation process based on the content produced.

### README in skill directory

The skill must include a **README file in the skill directory** (e.g., `README.md` at the root of the skill folder). This file is the human-facing overview of the skill and must cover:

- **The skill’s goal** — what the skill is for and what outcomes it enables
- **Key ideas of the skill** — core concepts, decision framework (data source and execution strategy), and how the skill guides the agent
- **Directory structure** — a concise description or diagram of the skill directory layout (e.g., `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and how they are used)

The README must not duplicate long reference material that belongs in `SKILL.md` or `references/`; it should orient the reader and point to those resources where appropriate.

### SKILL.md frontmatter

The `SKILL.md` file must include YAML frontmatter as required by the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification.md):

```yaml
---
name: blockscout-analysis
description: "MANDATORY — invoke this skill BEFORE making any Blockscout MCP tool calls or writing any blockchain data scripts, even when the Blockscout MCP server is already configured. Provides architectural rules, execution-strategy decisions, MCP REST API conventions for scripts, endpoint reference files, response transformation requirements, and output conventions that are not available from MCP tool descriptions alone. Use when the user asks about on-chain data, blockchain analysis, wallet balances, token transfers, contract interactions, on-chain metrics, wants to use the Blockscout API, or needs to build software that retrieves blockchain data via Blockscout. Covers all EVM chains."
license: MIT
metadata: {"author":"blockscout.com","version":"<current version>","github":"https://www.github.com/blockscout/agent-skills","support":"https://discord.gg/blockscout"}
---
```

- **`name`**: Must match the skill directory name (`blockscout-analysis`).
- **`description`**: Must fully reflect the skill's [Purpose](#purpose) — covering all goals the skill serves — and describe when to use it, with specific keywords that help agents identify relevant tasks. The description is the agent's primary signal for skill activation; any purpose not represented in the description may fail to trigger the skill. The description must also include a mandatory invocation directive instructing the agent to invoke the skill BEFORE making any Blockscout MCP tool calls or writing blockchain data scripts, even when the MCP server is already configured, and must explain that the skill provides architectural rules, execution-strategy decisions, and conventions not available from MCP tool descriptions alone.
  - **Single-line format**: The `description` value must be a single-line YAML string (quoted if it contains special characters). While the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification.md) permits multi-line YAML scalars, some skill-hosting platforms (notably OpenClaw) use frontmatter parsers that only support single-line keys. Using a single line ensures cross-platform compatibility at no cost to platforms that do support multi-line values.
- **`license`**: MIT.
- **`metadata`**: A single-line JSON object containing publisher and version information. Keys: `author`, `version`, `github`, `support`.
  - **`version`**: Skill version; must be updated on each release so that changes can be identified easily.
  - **`author`**, **`github`**, **`support`**: Publisher and support information.
  - **Single-line JSON format**: The `metadata` value must be written as a single-line JSON object (e.g., `{"author":"blockscout.com","version":"0.3.0",...}`). JSON inline objects are valid YAML 1.2, so every standard YAML parser accepts them. This format satisfies both the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification.md) (which requires metadata to be a map of string keys to string values) and OpenClaw's frontmatter parser (which only supports single-line keys). The multi-line nested YAML style (`metadata:\n  author: ...`) is functionally equivalent but breaks on OpenClaw's parser. Using single-line JSON ensures cross-platform compatibility at no cost to platforms that support multi-line values.

### MCP access strategy

- Scripts use the MCP REST API (`mcp.blockscout.com/v1/`) via HTTP
- **`direct_api_call` query-string encoding**: The skill must document that, over the REST API, `direct_api_call`'s nested `query_params` object is encoded using bracket syntax in the query string (`query_params[key]=value`), with at least one concrete example. Scope this to GET/query-string usage only — the reference files contain no POST endpoints, so the skill does not document the POST/JSON-body form.
- **User-Agent requirement**: Every HTTP request to the MCP REST API must include the header `User-Agent: Blockscout-SkillGuidedScript/<skill-version>` (where `<skill-version>` is the value from `SKILL.md` frontmatter `metadata.version`). The CDN in front of the MCP REST API rejects requests without a recognized User-Agent with HTTP 403. Because standard-library HTTP clients (e.g., Python `urllib`) send a generic User-Agent that is blocked, the skill must explicitly instruct the agent to set this header in every script. This avoids the recurring failure pattern where the agent writes a script, gets a 403, and then installs a third-party HTTP library to work around it.
- For interactive tasks better suited to native MCP tool calls (contract analysis, `read_contract`, iterative investigation), the skill instructs the agent to ensure the native MCP server is available (see [MCP server availability](#mcp-server-availability) below)
- The choice between script-based HTTP calls and direct MCP tool calls is governed by the execution strategy (see [Execution strategy](#execution-strategy) below)

### MCP server availability

- When the skill leads the agent to use Blockscout MCP tools, the skill must instruct the agent to **ensure the Blockscout MCP server is available** before relying on MCP tool calls. The agent should either provide the user with instructions to install or enable the MCP server, or, if the agent has the ability, install or enable the server automatically.
- The specification is **agent-agnostic**: The skill does not prescribe environment-specific steps (e.g., which config file or UI to use). It motivates the agent to achieve availability, assuming the agent knows how to install or enable an MCP server in its host environment.

### Decision framework

The skill must guide the agent through selecting **how to execute** the query. The MCP Server is the sole runtime data source; the decision is about execution strategy.

#### Data source priority

All data access goes through the Blockscout MCP Server:

- **Dedicated MCP tools** first (LLM-friendly, enriched, no auth) — prefer these when a tool directly answers the data need
- **`direct_api_call`** for endpoints not covered by dedicated MCP tools — consult the `references/blockscout-api-index.md` API index file to discover available endpoints
- **Chainscout** (`chains.blockscout.com/api`) only for resolving a chain ID to its Blockscout instance URL

#### Execution strategy

Choose the execution method based on task complexity, determinism, and whether semantic reasoning is required:

| Signal | Strategy | When to use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Simple lookup, 1–3 calls, no post-processing | **Direct tool calls** (MCP tool or web fetch) | The answer is returned directly or nearly directly by an MCP tool. E.g., get a block number, resolve an ENS name, fetch address info. |
| Deterministic multi-step flow with loops, date ranges, aggregation, or conditional branching | **Script** (agent writes and executes a script calling MCP REST API via HTTP) | The logic is well-defined and would be inefficient or error-prone as a sequence of LLM-driven calls. E.g., iterate over months to compute APY changes, paginate through all token holders to count matches, scan transaction history with filtering. |
| Data retrieval is simple but output requires math, normalization, or filtering | **Hybrid** (tool call for retrieval + script for post-processing) | The API provides raw data that needs token-decimal normalization, USD conversion, sorting, deduplication, or threshold filtering. E.g., get token balances via MCP then normalize amounts and filter by value in a script. |
| Task requires semantic understanding, code analysis, or subjective judgment | **LLM reasoning over API results** (direct tool calls, agent analyzes) | The question cannot be answered by a deterministic algorithm—it needs interpretation of contract source code, verification of token authenticity, classification of transaction purpose, or tracing code flow. E.g., check if a contract has blacklisting functionality, determine if a token is official, categorize a transaction. |
| Large data volume with known filtering criteria | **Script with `direct_api_call`** (script handles pagination and filtering) | Need to process many pages of data with programmatic filters. Use `direct_api_call` via the MCP REST API to access paginated endpoints. |

**Combination patterns**: Many real-world queries require combining strategies. For example, a multi-chain token balance analysis might use direct tool calls to resolve an ENS name, then a script to iterate through chains and fetch/normalize balances, with the LLM providing final interpretation of which tokens are "stablecoins."

**Probe-then-script**: When the execution strategy is "Script" but the agent needs to understand response structures before writing the script, call the relevant MCP tools natively with representative parameters first. Use the observed response structure to write the script targeting the REST API. Do not fall back to third-party data sources (e.g., direct RPC endpoints, third-party libraries) when the MCP REST API covers the data need.

The skill's decision table in `SKILL.md` must present the execution strategy so the agent selects the appropriate method for each task.

#### Tool selection priority

When a data need can be fulfilled by either a dedicated MCP tool or `direct_api_call`, the agent must prefer the dedicated MCP tool (enriched, LLM-friendly responses). Choose `direct_api_call` instead when: (a) no dedicated tool covers the needed endpoint, or (b) the dedicated tool is known — from its description or schema — not to return a field required for the task. This selection is made upfront during Phase 4 (endpoint discovery), not after calling a dedicated tool and discovering a gap at runtime.

**No redundant calls**: Once a tool or endpoint is selected for a data need, the agent must not call alternative tools for the same data.

### Query patterns

Several operational rules describe the correct way to assemble Blockscout MCP calls for recognizable shapes of analysis tasks — filtering data to a time window, locating the moment of a state transition, ensuring completeness across native and ERC-20 surfaces, resuming a time-ordered stream from a known anchor, etc. These rules are not about *which* tool to choose (that is the Decision framework's responsibility) but about *how* to assemble calls correctly once the tooling is fixed. They are skill-owned and live in `SKILL.md` so the agent reads them as part of skill activation, not from any external runtime source.

`SKILL.md` must therefore contain a top-level `## Query patterns` section, positioned between the Decision Framework and Response Transformation sections so the narrative reads: which tools exist → which tool to choose → how to assemble calls for this task shape → what to do with the response. Each subsection of `Query patterns` must:

- **State the shape of the task that triggers the pattern**, in a way the agent can match against the user's framing of the task (e.g., "tasks asking for the *moment* of an on-chain state transition").
- **State any preconditions the agent must check before applying the pattern**, especially preconditions whose violation produces *confidently wrong* answers rather than slow-but-correct ones (e.g., the monotonicity precondition for binary search).
- **Explain the mechanical reason the pattern is correct**, so the agent treats it as a defensible default rather than a magic recipe. This is the same "explain the why" principle the spec applies elsewhere.

#### Verbatim-text convention

For each pattern below, the spec gives three blocks:

- **Required coverage** — what the subsection addresses and which load-bearing facts must be preserved.
- **Historical source** — the upstream rule (if any) the formulation was originally derived from, and what is skill-originated on top of it. Provided for lineage/maintainer context only; the verbatim block below it is the authoritative formulation.
- **Verbatim text block**, delimited by `<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM:<slug> -->` and `<!-- END VERBATIM:<slug> -->` HTML comments. Everything between those markers is the canonical body of the corresponding subsection in `SKILL.md`.

`SKILL.md` mirrors the verbatim blocks, not the other way around:

- The verbatim block contains the body of the subsection, not its `###` heading; the heading wording is an implementation choice.
- Markdown cross-references inside verbatim blocks use `SKILL.md`-internal anchors (e.g., `(#response-transformation)`). They resolve in `SKILL.md`; in this spec they intentionally have no equivalent target.
- Whitespace and punctuation inside verbatim blocks are part of the canon; trivial autoformatter changes are acceptable, semantic edits to the wording are not — those go through the spec.

When a pattern's wording needs refinement, the verbatim block in this spec is changed first; `SKILL.md` is then re-mirrored from it. This spec is the source of truth for both *what* is required and *how* it must be phrased.

The skill must address, at minimum, the five query patterns enumerated below. The first two cover time-related task shapes; the next two are completeness checks against the native-coin / ERC-20 structural fork in the data model; the last governs anchor-based continuation, separately from cursor pagination. Adding a new required pattern, removing one of these, or substantively changing the coverage or verbatim text of one is a spec change.

#### Pattern: Time-bounded retrieval

**Required coverage.** Recognition of tasks that constrain the answer to a time range; recommendation to start with the time-filtered transaction-level tools (`get_transactions_by_address`, `get_token_transfers_by_address` with `age_from`/`age_to`); the mechanical reason (other endpoints lack a time filter, so honoring a time bound on them forces full-history pagination); the carve-out for converting a wall-clock instant into a block number (`get_block_number(datetime=...)`); and a cross-reference to the state-transition pattern so the agent does not conflate the two.

**Historical source.** Originally derived from `unlock_blockchain_analysis` → `time_based_query_rules` (which covered the recommendation to start from transaction-level tools with `age_from`/`age_to`). Skill-originated additions: the mechanical-rationale paragraph, the `get_block_number(datetime=...)` carve-out, and the cross-reference to *Locating historical state changes*.

<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM:time-bounded-queries -->

When the task constrains the answer to a time range (before/after a date, between two dates, "in the last N days"), start with the transaction-level tools that accept time filters: `get_transactions_by_address` and `get_token_transfers_by_address`, using the `age_from` and `age_to` parameters. Retrieve associated data (logs, internal token transfers, receipt details) from the transactions returned by those calls, not by trying to time-filter other endpoints directly.

The reason is mechanical: most other Blockscout endpoints have no time-filter parameter. Without `age_from`/`age_to`, the only way to honor a time bound on those endpoints is to paginate from one end of history until the timestamps fall inside the requested window — that grows linearly with chain history and burns a lot of calls. Starting from the time-filtered endpoints scopes the work to the actual window.

**Carve-out — "find the block at this moment".** When the task is to convert a wall-clock instant into a block number (or to anchor a follow-up query to a block boundary), use `get_block_number(datetime=...)` directly. This is the cheapest and most accurate path; do not bisect transaction history to discover a block boundary that the server can return in one call.

For tasks asking *when* a state transition happened (e.g., "in which block did X change") rather than for data inside a window, see [Locating historical state changes](#locating-historical-state-changes).

<!-- END VERBATIM:time-bounded-queries -->

#### Pattern: Locating historical state transitions

**Required coverage.** Recognition of tasks asking for the moment of an on-chain state transition; **the monotonicity precondition stated visibly in the section body, not in a footnote** (this prevents the worst failure mode — confidently wrong answers from misapplied bisection on non-monotonic state); the bracket → bisect → probe pattern, explicitly bisecting by block number rather than by paginated item index; per-probe-type guidance for choosing the smallest deterministic check (`read_contract`, `direct_api_call`, `get_block_info`); termination-boundary distinctions (first block where the predicate holds, last block where it did not, exact flipping transaction); and load-bearing edge cases (reorg risk at the chain tip, contract not yet deployed at the probe block).

**Historical source.** Originally derived from `unlock_blockchain_analysis` → `binary_search_rules` (which covered temporal-boundary bisection via `age_from`/`age_to` only). Most of this pattern is skill-originated: the **monotonicity precondition** (the source rule did not state it and its example was implicitly monotonic); the bracket/bisect/probe terminology and structure for block-level state; the probe-tool guidance; the termination-boundary distinctions; and the reorg / pre-deployment edge cases.

<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM:locating-historical-state-changes -->

Some tasks ask for the *moment* of an on-chain state transition rather than the values themselves: "in which block did the supply first exceed N", "when did this address first become a holder", "find the transaction after which the contract was paused", "at what block did role X get granted". Pagination is the wrong tool for these — scanning history grows linearly with transactions, while bisection over block numbers grows logarithmically. Use binary search.

**Monotonicity precondition (mandatory).** Binary search returns a correct answer only when the predicate is **monotonic** over the bracketed range — once it flips, it stays flipped. The classic safe cases are "first block where the predicate becomes true" (and stays true) or "last block where it remained false". Non-monotonic predicates are not eligible for binary search. Concretely:

- Paused/unpaused toggles, balances that go up and down, repeated threshold crossings, role grants followed by role revokes — none of these can be located with a single bisection, because the midpoint check tells you *whether* the predicate holds there, not *which* crossing you have hit.
- For genuinely non-monotonic predicates, use event/log scanning (`/api/v2/transactions/{hash}/logs` via `direct_api_call`, or `get_transactions_by_address` / `get_token_transfers_by_address` with a time filter and post-filtering for the event of interest).
- Sometimes the task can be re-cast: the *first* occurrence of a non-monotonic event is still a monotonic question ("first block at which the count of pause events is ≥ 1"). If you can split the range into segments that are individually monotonic — known deployments, known event boundaries — bisecting each segment is also fine. Otherwise scan.

If you are not sure the predicate is monotonic, say so and scan; a wrong "first block" answer from a misapplied bisection is worse than a slower correct one.

**Pattern: bracket → bisect → probe.**

1. **Bracket** the search range with two block numbers, `lo` and `hi`, where the predicate is known (or assumed) to hold one value at `lo` and the other at `hi`. Sources:
   - Time-stated bound → `get_block_number(datetime=...)`.
   - Open-ended bound → chain tip (current block via `get_block_number()`), contract deployment block, or genesis (`0`).
   - If the contract did not exist at `lo`, narrow `lo` to the deployment block before starting.
2. **Bisect** by block number — never by transaction count, position in a paginated list, or any other index. Block numbers are dense and uniform across what binary search needs.
3. **Probe** the midpoint with the smallest deterministic check that answers the predicate:
   - On-chain state at a block → `read_contract` with the relevant function and `block` parameter.
   - Indexed Blockscout field at a block → `direct_api_call` against the appropriate endpoint with a block scope.
   - Block-level facts (timestamp, base fee, miner) → `get_block_info`.

   Choose the probe so that one call decides the bisection direction; avoid probes that need follow-up calls to interpret.

**Termination.** Stop when `hi - lo` is `1` (or whatever resolution the task accepts). Be explicit about which boundary the task asks for:

- *First block where the predicate holds* → return `hi` when the bisection settles with the predicate `false` at `lo` and `true` at `hi`.
- *Last block where it did not hold* → return `lo` from the same settled bracket.
- *The exact transaction that flipped the state* → after the block is found, do one more pass within that block (its transaction list and event logs) to pick out the flipping tx.

**Edge cases.**

- *Very recent history.* The last handful of blocks can reorg; a probe there may return a different answer minutes later. If the task touches the chain tip, mention the reorg risk in the answer or wait for additional confirmations before reporting a definitive block.
- *Contract not yet deployed at the probe block.* `read_contract` at a pre-deployment block fails deterministically. Treat this as evidence that the deployment block is between the current `lo` and the probe, and narrow `lo` upward instead of recording a "false" reading.
- *Non-uniform block times across chains.* L2s and PoS chains have variable block times. This does not affect correctness — the bisection runs on block numbers, not time.

<!-- END VERBATIM:locating-historical-state-changes -->

#### Pattern: Complete portfolio queries

**Required coverage.** Recognition of portfolio / net-worth / total-assets / "top tokens by value" tasks; the tool pairing `get_address_info` (native coin) + `get_tokens_by_address` (ERC-20); the requirement that the native-coin balance must appear as a candidate when ranking or selecting top tokens by USD value (otherwise the largest position on most addresses is silently excluded); and the framing as a completeness check rather than a tool-choice decision.

**Historical source.** Originally derived from `unlock_blockchain_analysis` → `portfolio_analysis_rules` (which covered the pairing and the native-coin-in-ranking requirement). Skill-originated additions: the explicit framing as a completeness check (vs. a strategy decision) and the cross-link to *Data source priority*.

<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM:complete-portfolio-queries -->

When the task asks for a portfolio, net worth, total assets, holdings, or "top tokens by value" for an address, query **both** value surfaces before answering:

- `get_address_info` — native-coin balance (ETH/MATIC/etc.) and its USD valuation.
- `get_tokens_by_address` — ERC-20 holdings.

These surfaces live in different parts of the data model and are returned by different tools; one tool does not subsume the other. For most addresses the largest position is in the native coin, so an answer built only from `get_tokens_by_address` is dominated by what was not queried. When ranking or selecting top tokens by USD value, include the native-coin balance from `get_address_info` as a candidate alongside the ERC-20 entries — otherwise the "top" position is silently excluded from the ranking.

This is a completeness check, not a strategy decision; the choice of tools was already settled by the [Data source priority](#data-source-priority). The pattern exists because the natural reading of "portfolio" hides a structural fork in the data model.

#### Pattern: Complete funds-movement queries

**Required coverage.** Recognition of funds-movement / recent-transfers / activity / sends-and-receives tasks; the tool pairing `get_transactions_by_address` (native) + `get_token_transfers_by_address` (ERC-20); explicit warning that the word "transactions" in user prompts cannot be assumed to mean native-only; and a cross-reference to the portfolio pattern (same nature).

**Historical source.** Originally derived from `unlock_blockchain_analysis` → `funds_movement_rules` (which covered the pairing and the warning). Skill-originated additions: the cross-reference to *Complete portfolio queries* and the framing of the two patterns as sharing a "completeness on a structural fork" nature.

<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM:complete-funds-movement-queries -->

When the task asks about funds movement, recent transfers, transaction activity, or "what this address has been sending and receiving", query **both** transfer surfaces:

- `get_transactions_by_address` — native-coin transactions (ETH/MATIC/etc.).
- `get_token_transfers_by_address` — ERC-20 token transfers.

Native-coin and ERC-20 movement travel along different rails on EVM chains (transactions versus `Transfer` events) and surface through different tools. The word "transactions" in user prompts sometimes means *only* native-coin transactions and sometimes means *all funds movement*; for a funds-movement question, take the broader reading. If the user genuinely wants native-only, they will usually scope the question to the native ticker explicitly.

Same nature as [Complete portfolio queries](#complete-portfolio-queries) — a completeness check on a question whose natural framing hides a structural fork in the data model.

<!-- END VERBATIM:complete-funds-movement-queries -->

#### Pattern: Anchor-based resumption in time-ordered streams

**Required coverage.** Recognition of "resume from a known anchor" tasks; explicit distinction from cursor pagination (cursor advances the *same* request; anchor resumption builds a *new* query around an external item); the descending order of time-ordered tools; the per-tool ordering keys (`get_transactions_by_address`, `get_token_transfers_by_address`, logs via `direct_api_call`) presented as a comparable table; the resume pattern (set `age_from` or `age_to` to the anchor's block timestamp, then filter client-side on the full ordering tuple); the load-bearing constraint that the **anchor's block must stay inside the queried temporal window** (do not narrow the timestamp range to exclude it — the boundary partition is the client-side filter's job); a concrete worked example; and the explicit precondition that the full ordering tuple must be compared, not just `block_number` (silent duplicates/gaps in the boundary block is the failure mode).

**Historical source.** Originally derived from `unlock_blockchain_analysis` → `data_ordering_and_resumption_rules` (which covered the DESC ordering, the per-tool ordering keys, the resume pattern, the worked example, and the full-tuple-comparison rule). Skill-originated additions: the explicit framing as "distinct from cursor pagination" with a cross-link to `MCP pagination`; the explicit linkage between "never skip the anchor's block" and "do not narrow the timestamp window".

<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM:resuming-a-time-ordered-stream -->

This pattern applies when the agent already has an **anchor** — a specific transaction, token transfer, or log it has seen before — and needs the items strictly *earlier* or strictly *later* than that anchor in the natural ordering. This is distinct from [MCP pagination](#mcp-pagination): cursor pagination dispenses the next page of the *same* request, whereas here the anchor comes from outside (a previous session, a user reference, a deduplicated result set) and the agent must build a new query around it.

The time-ordered Blockscout tools — `get_transactions_by_address`, `get_token_transfers_by_address`, and logs via `direct_api_call` — return items in **descending** order (newest first) and order items *within the same block* by additional position keys. Filtering by timestamp alone is not sufficient: the anchor sits in some block, and the other items in that same block must be partitioned correctly across the boundary, or the result will silently duplicate the anchor (or items adjacent to it) or silently skip items that should have been returned.

**Ordering keys (descending).** Compare these as full tuples, not just by `block_number`:

| Tool | Ordering key |
|------|--------------|
| `get_transactions_by_address` | `(block_number, transaction_index, internal_transaction_index)` |
| `get_token_transfers_by_address` | `(block_number, transaction_index, token_transfer_batch_index, token_transfer_index)` |
| `direct_api_call` (logs) | `(block_number, log_index)` — `log_index` is global within the block |

**Resume pattern.**

1. Resolve the anchor's block timestamp (`get_block_info` if not already known).
2. Query the same tool with one of `age_from` / `age_to` set to that timestamp:
   - To fetch items **earlier** than the anchor: `age_to = anchor_block_timestamp`.
   - To fetch items **later** than the anchor: `age_from = anchor_block_timestamp`.
3. Filter the response client-side using the **complete** ordering tuple:
   - Earlier-than: keep items whose ordering key is strictly less than the anchor's.
   - Later-than: keep items whose ordering key is strictly greater than the anchor's.

Do **not** narrow the timestamp window to exclude the anchor's block. The anchor's block must stay inside the queried range — items earlier than the anchor that live in the same block would be lost otherwise. The exclusion of the anchor itself (and of items on the wrong side of it within the boundary block) is the job of the client-side tuple filter, not of the timestamp bounds.

**Example.** Anchor is a token transfer at `(block=1000, tx_idx=5, transfer_idx=3)`. To fetch earlier transfers:

- Query: `get_token_transfers_by_address(..., age_to = timestamp_of_block_1000)`.
- Filter (keep only): `block < 1000` OR `(block == 1000 AND tx_idx < 5)` OR `(block == 1000 AND tx_idx == 5 AND transfer_idx < 3)`.

**Precondition.** Compare the *complete* ordering tuple, not just `block_number`. Comparing only by block silently produces duplicates in the boundary block (when fetching later items) or silent gaps (when fetching earlier items) — both failures look like correct output unless someone spot-checks the boundary.

### Price data and financial disclaimer

Blockscout infrastructure may expose native coin or token prices in some responses (e.g., token holdings, market data). By its nature, these prices may not be up to date, may differ from actual market prices, and do not constitute historical price series.

- **No financial decisions on Blockscout prices alone**: The skill must instruct the agent **not** to make or suggest any financial advice or decisions based solely on prices returned by Blockscout.
- **Use of Blockscout prices**: The skill must instruct the agent to use prices returned by Blockscout only to provide an **approximate or rough value** when that is sufficient for the user's request. When the user's request requires accurate, up-to-date, or historical prices, the agent must use or recommend **other price sources** (e.g., dedicated price oracles, market data APIs, or financial data providers).

### Response transformation

Raw Blockscout API responses (especially those returned by `direct_api_call`) can be very heavy from a token-consumption perspective. Scripts querying the MCP REST API must transform responses before passing output to the LLM:

- **Extract only fields relevant to the user's question** — omit unneeded fields from response objects
- **Filter list elements** — when the response contains lists, retain only the elements that match the user's criteria rather than passing entire arrays
- **Handle heavy data blobs intelligently** — large fields such as transaction calldata, NFT metadata, log contents, and encoded byte arrays should be filtered, decoded, summarized, or flagged for matching rather than included verbatim
- **Flatten nested structures where possible** — reduce object nesting depth to simplify downstream processing
- **Large response bypass**: When scripts use the `X-Blockscout-Allow-Large-Response: true` header to bypass the `direct_api_call` size limit, response transformation is especially critical — the full untruncated response may be very large and must be filtered, extracted, and flattened before any part reaches the LLM.

### Secure handling of API response data (prompt injection awareness)

API responses return data stored on the blockchain and sometimes data from third-party sources. This data is not controlled by Blockscout or the agent and may be adversarial.

- **Untrusted content**: Responses can include token names, NFT metadata, collection URLs, decoded transaction call data, decoded logs data, and similar fields that are either on-chain or fetched from external metadata (e.g., IPFS, HTTP). Such content can contain prompt injections or other malicious text aimed at steering or confusing the model.
- **Skill obligation**: The skill must instruct the agent to treat all such response data as untrusted and to handle it securely during analysis.
- **Agent behavior**: The agent must be aware that prompt injections may be present in API response data and must apply secure handling practices (e.g., clearly separating user intent from quoted or pasted API data, avoiding treating response text as instructions, and summarizing or sanitizing when feeding data back into reasoning or output) so that analysis remains robust and aligned with the user's actual request.

## Analysis Workflow

The skill must describe a workflow that guides the agent through starting and conducting a blockchain analysis task. The skill must instruct the agent to follow at least the phases below, in order. The workflow is not purely linear—the agent may revisit earlier phases as new information emerges (e.g., discovering during endpoint research that a different execution strategy is more appropriate).

### 1. Identify the target chain

- Determine which blockchain the user is asking about from the context of the user's query.
- Default to chain ID `1` (Ethereum Mainnet) when the query does not specify a chain or clearly refers to Ethereum.
- Use the `get_chains_list(query="...")` MCP tool to validate the chain ID — pass the chain name or ecosystem the user mentioned (e.g., "Polygon", "Base") so only relevant chains are returned, falling back to a no-argument call only if the query returns no matches. When the Blockscout instance URL is needed (e.g., for constructing explorer links), use Chainscout to resolve the chain ID to its Blockscout instance URL (see [Chainscout](#chainscout)).

### 2. Choose the execution strategy

- Evaluate the task against the [execution strategy](#execution-strategy) decision table.
- Select the appropriate execution method **before** making any data-fetching API calls.
- The choice may be revised later if endpoint research (phase 4) reveals constraints (e.g., the data volume requires scripting).

### 3. Ensure tooling availability

- If the strategy involves native MCP tool calls, ensure the Blockscout MCP server is available in the current environment. If it is not available, either provide the user with installation instructions or install or enable it automatically (if the agent has the capability to do so in its host environment).
- **Fallback to REST API**: When the native MCP server cannot be made available, the agent must fall back to the MCP REST API (`https://mcp.blockscout.com/v1/`) for all data access. In this case, the agent should use `GET https://mcp.blockscout.com/v1/tools` to obtain tool names, descriptions, and input parameters, and then call tools via their REST endpoints.
- **Scripts target the user's environment**: When the agent's runtime environment cannot reach the MCP REST API (e.g., sandbox network restrictions) but native MCP tools are available, the agent must still write scripts targeting the REST API — the script is intended to run in the user's environment, not the agent's sandbox. Use native MCP tool calls to validate response formats during script development (see [response format equivalence](#1-blockscout-mcp-server)).

### 4. Discover endpoints

For each data need identified in the task, determine whether a dedicated MCP tool can fulfill it. If not, discover the appropriate `direct_api_call` endpoint:

1. **Check dedicated MCP tools**: Review the available MCP tools. If a dedicated tool answers the data need, use it (per [tool selection priority](#tool-selection-priority)).
2. **Discover `direct_api_call` endpoints** (two-step process): When the task requires endpoints beyond what dedicated MCP tools cover, the agent must follow this sequence:
   1. **Read the index file** (`references/blockscout-api-index.md`): Locate the endpoint by name or category to identify which API reference file contains its full documentation.
   2. **Read the corresponding reference file** (`references/blockscout-api/{filename}.md`): Inspect the endpoint's parameters, types, and descriptions for use with `direct_api_call`.

   The agent must not skip the index step—it is the only reliable way to find which reference file documents a given endpoint.

### 5. Plan the actions

- Based on the chosen strategy and discovered endpoints, produce a concrete action plan before execution.
- For **script-based** strategies: outline what the script will do—which endpoints it will call, how it handles pagination, what filtering or aggregation it performs, and the expected output format.
- For **direct tool calls**: list the sequence of tool calls and what information each call provides.
- For **hybrid** approaches: specify which parts are handled by tool calls and which by a script.
- For **LLM reasoning** strategies: identify which data must be retrieved first and what kind of analysis the agent will perform on the results.

### 6. Execute

- Carry out the plan: make tool calls, write and run ad-hoc scripts, or both.
- Ad-hoc scripts must follow the dependency requirements from [Modular structure](#modular-structure): standard library and host-available tools only, with MCP tools as the escape hatch before considering any package installation.
- Scripts that call the MCP REST API (especially `direct_api_call`) must apply [response transformation](#response-transformation)—extract relevant fields, flatten nested structures, format output for token-efficient LLM consumption.
- After execution, the agent should interpret results in the context of the user's original question rather than simply presenting raw output.

## Implementation Notes

- The `direct_api_call` MCP tool is a proxy to Blockscout API endpoints and does not provide optimization or filtering.
- Some MCP tools automatically enrich responses by performing additional API calls internally (e.g., address info enriched with metadata and first transaction timestamp), so dedicated MCP tools can reduce the total number of calls compared to using `direct_api_call`.
- The MCP server simplifies complex cursor logic for paginated endpoints, making it more suitable for LLMs.
- MCP pagination uses ~10 items per page; enriched responses from dedicated tools may save follow-up queries.
- The `references/blockscout-api-index.md` and `references/blockscout-api/{filename}.md` files produced during the [skill preparation phase](#skill-preparation-phase) serve as the endpoint reference for `direct_api_call` usage—the agent consults them to discover endpoint paths and parameters.
