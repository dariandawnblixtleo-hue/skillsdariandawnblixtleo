# `web3-dev` Skill — Specification

This document specifies the `web3-dev` skill. It is the input for the
`skill-creator` skill, which composes the actual `SKILL.md` body and frontmatter
from this spec.

---

## Purpose

The `web3-dev` skill helps AI agents build web3 applications, scripts, tools,
mobile apps, and desktop apps that require blockchain data. It instructs the
agent how to use the **Blockscout PRO API**
(https://docs.blockscout.com/devs/pro-api.md) to request that data, and which
data is available through the API by providing the full list of endpoints.

The skill is intended for agents that need direct HTTP access to the Blockscout
PRO API — distinct from the `blockscout-analysis` skill, which operates through
the Blockscout MCP Server.

---

## Skill directory layout

The skill lives at the project root:

```
web3-dev/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── pro-api.json          # Full Blockscout PRO API OpenAPI v3.0 spec
    └── pro-api-index.md      # Generated index of all endpoints (by tag)
```

Both `pro-api.json` and `pro-api-index.md` are bundled with the skill. The
`SKILL.md` body must reference them by their **paths relative to the skill
directory** (e.g. `references/pro-api.json`, `references/pro-api-index.md`).

> **Important — what the skill body must NOT mention:**
>
> - The build-time clone of the `pro-api` repository under
>   `web3-dev/.build/pro-api` (gitignored; populated only when the upgrade
>   pipeline runs).
> - The `build-pro-api.sh` generator script that lives inside that clone.
> - The `pro-api-indexer.py` script or its specification under
>   `.memory_bank/specs/web3-dev/`.
>
> These are build-time artefacts used to prepare the bundled files. From the
> skill's point of view, `references/pro-api.json` and
> `references/pro-api-index.md` simply exist inside the skill directory.

---

## Pre-skill-generation steps (build-time, NOT part of the skill body)

Before `skill-creator` is invoked, the two bundled reference files must be
produced:

- `web3-dev/references/pro-api.json` — the OpenAPI spec, derived from a
  build-time clone of the upstream `pro-api` repository (which carries the
  generator `build-pro-api.sh`). The clone lives in the gitignored
  `web3-dev/.build/pro-api` directory.
- `web3-dev/references/pro-api-index.md` — generated from `pro-api.json` by
  `.memory_bank/specs/web3-dev/tools/pro-api-indexer.py` (specified in
  `.memory_bank/specs/web3-dev/pro-api-indexer-spec.md`).

The exact step-by-step procedure (clone recipe with the current pinned commit,
build invocation, copy, indexer call, verification) is the responsibility of
the `upgrade-blockscout-api` skill and lives in
`.claude/skills/upgrade-blockscout-api/references/web3-dev.md`. That document
is the single source of truth for the build pipeline; this spec must not
duplicate it.

### Compose the skill body

Invoke `skill-creator` with this specification. The resulting `SKILL.md` must
follow the rules in the next section.

---

## Skill body — required content

The body must teach an agent how to:

1. Discover which Blockscout PRO API endpoint to call for a given data need.
2. Read the parameter and response specification for that endpoint **without
   exhausting context** by reading the whole OpenAPI document.
3. Authenticate and call the endpoint.
4. Track API credit usage.

### A. PRO API facts (must appear in the skill body)

The skill body must include the following facts. They are sourced from
https://docs.blockscout.com/devs/pro-api.md and the runtime config endpoints
listed below.

#### What the PRO API is

- A single, unified HTTP API providing **production-grade blockchain data
  across 100+ EVM chains** (94+ L2s and scaling projects included). One API
  key works across every supported chain — switch chains by changing the
  `chain_id` parameter on the call.
- Returns **explorer-enriched** data: indexed, decoded, structured —
  including token metadata, proxy implementations, internal transactions,
  and contract context.
- **Wedge 1 — the introduction must mention `eth_call`.** The
  top-of-file paragraphs of the skill body (the mental model the agent
  forms in the first ~30 lines) must explicitly call out that, in
  addition to the indexed REST surface, the PRO API also exposes
  `eth_call` through its JSON-RPC gateway for **live or historical
  contract state at a specific block** — historical `balanceOf(addr)`,
  `totalSupply()` at a past block, view-function calls, contract
  storage reads. The introduction must state explicitly that **no
  separate RPC URL is required** — the same Bearer auth covers both
  surfaces. Concrete content the body should reproduce:

  > For data the explorer has **not** pre-indexed — most importantly
  > **live or historical contract state at a specific block** (e.g.
  > `balanceOf(addr)` against a token contract at block `N`,
  > `totalSupply()` at a past block, any view-function call, contract
  > storage reads) — the PRO API also exposes `eth_call` through its
  > JSON-RPC gateway. The same Bearer-token auth covers both surfaces;
  > you do **not** need a separate RPC endpoint for historical
  > contract reads.

  Rationale: without this early framing the agent forms a "REST-only"
  mental model and reaches for an external RPC URL the moment a task
  needs contract state.
- Target use cases: dApps & wallets (transaction history, balances, NFTs),
  AI agents & bots (monitoring/automation), analytics platforms (cross-chain
  analysis), operational tooling (debugging, compliance).
- **The OpenAPI specification (`references/pro-api.json`) and the index
  (`references/pro-api-index.md`) are the single source of truth for which
  endpoints exist and how to call them.** The skill body must NOT classify
  endpoints into separate "families" or steer the agent toward a subset —
  every endpoint listed in the index is callable and uses the same
  authentication scheme.
- **Tag names in the index are organisational, not normative.** The index
  groups endpoints by their OpenAPI tag (`addresses`, `blocks`,
  `transactions`, chain-specific tags, `legacy`, …). The skill body must
  not treat any tag — `legacy` in particular — as deprecated, discouraged,
  or to-be-avoided. All tagged endpoints are first-class and callable. If
  the skill body discusses tags at all, it must do so neutrally (e.g. "the
  index is grouped by OpenAPI tag, including `legacy`; pick the endpoint
  whose description matches the data need") and must not imply that
  `legacy`-tagged endpoints should be avoided or used only as a fallback.
- **Disambiguating candidates with full operation descriptions.** The
  one-line summaries in `references/pro-api-index.md` are not always
  sufficient to pick a single endpoint — several entries may look
  plausible, or none may match on a first pass. The skill body must
  instruct the agent, before giving up or asking the user, to **shortlist
  the plausible candidate endpoints and read their full operation
  descriptions** from `references/pro-api.json` via
  `oastools walk operations -detail -format json -path '<PATH>' …
  | jq '.operation.description'`. The full operation description in the
  OpenAPI spec frequently contains discriminating detail (accepted input
  shapes, populated response fields, chain-type applicability) that is
  not captured in the index's one-liner.
- **Out-of-index requests.** Only after the candidate-shortlist step
  above has been exhausted may the skill instruct the agent to surface
  the gap to the user — and even then it must not silently substitute a
  third-party data source. This rule must NOT be phrased as "do not fall
  back to legacy endpoints", since legacy endpoints are valid in-index
  endpoints, not a fallback.

#### Registration and API keys — mandatory pre-flight

A PRO API key is **required** to call any endpoint. The skill must enforce
this as a hard pre-flight check before issuing any HTTP request.

**Pre-flight rule (the skill body must implement this verbatim in spirit):**

1. Before the first PRO API call in a session, check whether the API key is
   available to the agent. Acceptable sources, in this order of preference:
   - An environment variable already exported in the agent's shell
     (default name: `BLOCKSCOUT_PRO_API_KEY`).
   - A project-local secrets file appropriate for the target artefact
     (e.g. `.env` for Node/Python apps, `.env.local` for Next.js,
     `local.properties` for Android, `*.xcconfig` / Keychain for iOS,
     `secrets.toml` for some Python frameworks, a CI secret store, etc.).
   - A key the user previously placed in the agent's stored memory or
     persistent profile (e.g. a saved-secrets / preferences store the
     agent has access to across sessions).

   **Conversation paste is NOT an acceptable source and the skill body
   must not solicit it.** A pasted value lands in the LLM transcript and
   can leak via provider logs, exported chats, screenshots, or training
   corpora. The skill body must steer the user to `export` or a
   gitignored `.env` instead, and must include a key-handling rule that
   accepts an unsolicited paste *for the current session only*, warns
   the user that the value is now in the transcript, and recommends
   rotating the key plus using `export`/`.env` thereafter.

   The skill must **never invent or guess a key**, and must **never use a
   key from training data or any source other than those listed above**.
2. **Confirmation rule for stored memory / cross-session keys.** A key
   the user has intentionally saved to the agent's memory or profile is
   a legitimate source, but reusing it silently is not. The skill body
   must instruct the agent, before issuing the first request that uses
   such a key, to surface *which* stored key it intends to use — by
   slot/name and a non-secret hint such as the last 4 characters — and
   ask the user to confirm. The full key value must never be echoed back
   to the user. Keys found in the current session's environment or in a
   project-local secrets file do **not** require this extra confirmation
   step — they are by construction intentional for the current task.
3. If the key is **not** available from any of the sources above, the
   skill must enforce a **hard interrupt** — not a soft warning. The
   skill body must explicitly forbid every form of preparatory or
   "deferred" work, because an observed failure mode is the agent
   rationalising that *writing code* is not *making a request*. The
   forbidden behaviours that the skill body must enumerate are:

   - writing or sketching code that calls (or will eventually call) the
     PRO API;
   - "preparing a script for when the key arrives" or doing any
     preparatory endpoint inspection / parameter walk / response-schema
     traversal;
   - proposing an alternative data source or an external RPC URL as a
     stopgap;
   - narrating hypothetical next steps as if the key situation were
     resolved.

   Instead, the agent must send a brief, concrete message that:
   (a) names the missing key, (b) points the user at the Blockscout
   developer portal at **https://dev.blockscout.com** (free tier, no
   credit card), and (c) offers two **paste-free** paths:
   `export BLOCKSCOUT_PRO_API_KEY=proapi_…` in the current shell, or
   a gitignored `.env` in the project root. The skill body must **not**
   ask the user to paste the key into the conversation (see rule 1's
   note on conversation-paste exposure). The agent then waits.

   The skill body must include both an **anti-pattern example** (the
   wrong shape) and a **canonical example** (the right shape), because
   without a concrete contrast the agent invents its own response and
   tends to hedge. Reproduce these verbatim or close to it:

   > ❌ Wrong: *"No API key found in environment. Let me check the
   > endpoint parameters and build the script — it'll use the
   > Blockscout PRO API for token transfers (when a key is
   > available)."*
   >
   > ✅ Right: *"I couldn't find a Blockscout PRO API key. Generate
   > one at https://dev.blockscout.com (free tier, no credit card),
   > then either run `export BLOCKSCOUT_PRO_API_KEY=proapi_…` in this
   > shell, or add it to a gitignored `.env` in the project root. The
   > value won't appear in our conversation either way. Tell me when
   > you're done."*

   The skill body must also state the **stronger underlying reason**
   the stop is hard, not just discipline: **the agent needs the key
   for its own research and debug calls**, not only for the user's
   eventual code. Probing an endpoint to confirm its real response
   shape, validating a parameter combination by trying it, and
   debugging why an earlier call returned unexpected data are all live
   PRO API calls the agent makes during planning and iteration.
   Without a key, the agent cannot do that exploratory work — meaning
   it cannot reliably design the user's code in the first place.
   "Build the script now, run it later when the key arrives" therefore
   produces code that was never validated against the actual API. The
   skill body should make this point explicitly so the agent has a
   concrete reason to stop, not only a rule to follow.

   Rationale: the previous wording ("stop — do not attempt any PRO API
   request, do not proceed with partial work") was too easy for an
   agent to read narrowly as "do not issue an HTTP call now", while
   continuing to write code in the meantime. Forbidding preparatory
   work explicitly, surfacing the developer-portal URL inline in the
   stop rule (not only in the separate on-boarding subsection),
   anchoring with both an anti-pattern and a canonical example, **and
   stating the agent's own loss of research / debug capability** are
   the four changes that close that gap.
4. If the key **is** available (and confirmed where required by rule 2),
   validate it loosely (it should start with `proapi_`) and proceed.

**On-boarding instructions the skill must deliver when the key is missing**
(the wording in `SKILL.md` may be tightened, but every step below must be
present and in this order):

1. Open the developer portal at **https://dev.blockscout.com** and create
   an account. The free tier does not require a credit card.
2. From the portal, generate an API key. The key will be prefixed
   `proapi_…`. An account can hold up to 50 keys, and the portal shows a
   real-time usage dashboard.
3. **Recommend the most appropriate place to store the key** for the
   user's specific case. The agent must propose, not impose — pick the
   option that is the most secure *and* the most convenient given what is
   being built. Examples (the skill body must illustrate this kind of
   case-by-case choice, not memorise a fixed list):

   - One-off interactive script the user runs locally → an exported shell
     variable in the current session, or a shell-rc entry if they will
     reuse it.
   - Node.js / Python / Go application or CLI → a project-local `.env`
     file loaded at startup, with `.env` added to `.gitignore`.
   - Frontend / mobile / desktop app where the binary ships to end users →
     **never embed the key in the client**. Route requests through a
     server-side proxy that holds the key, or have each end user supply
     their own key via the app's settings UI (stored in OS Keychain /
     Keystore / equivalent).
   - CI/CD pipeline → the platform's encrypted secret store
     (GitHub Actions secrets, GitLab CI variables, etc.).
   - Containerised deployment → secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager,
     GCP Secret Manager, Vault, …) injected at runtime.

   The skill body must instruct the agent to **ask a clarifying question**
   when the deployment shape is ambiguous, and to flag any user request to
   embed the key in committed code or in a client-shipped binary as
   insecure.
4. Re-run the original request once the key is in place.

**Key handling rules** (must also be in the skill body):

- Never log the key, never include it in committed code, never echo it back
  to the user once provided.
- Always read the key indirectly at runtime (env var, secrets file, secret
  manager) — do not hardcode it in scripts or examples; in code samples,
  reference it by variable name only.
- If a `.env` (or equivalent secrets file) is created or modified, ensure
  it is git-ignored and warn the user if it is not.
- Treat `HTTP 401`/`403` responses as a signal that the key is invalid or
  revoked: stop, surface the failure, and re-run the on-boarding flow.

#### Required request headers (beyond auth)

The skill body must include a section instructing the agent to set, on
**every** PRO API request, both:

- **`User-Agent`** — a meaningful, identifiable string for the app or
  script (e.g. `<name>/<version>`).
- **`Accept: application/json`**.

The motivation is a real failure observed in practice: the PRO API is
fronted by a CDN that may block requests whose default `User-Agent`
looks like a bare HTTP-library client. The classic signature is **`curl`
working while a script fails on the same URL**, and the failure mode
varies by client — HTTP `403` with a Cloudflare HTML body containing
`error code: 1010`, an empty body, or a connection reset.

The skill body must:

- Phrase the guidance **library-agnostic**, not Python-specific. Python
  `urllib` is one example of a bare client whose default User-Agent
  (`Python-urllib/3.x`) gets flagged, but the same issue appears with
  generic Java `HttpURLConnection`, hand-rolled Go `net/http` without a
  configured client, etc. Higher-level libraries (Python
  `requests`/`httpx`, Node `fetch`/`undici`, OkHttp, hardened Go
  clients, …) usually send a reasonable User-Agent by default — but
  explicitly setting both headers is the recommended practice for
  portability and CDN-tightening resilience.
- Tell the agent that this failure is **not a credentials problem**.
  Re-running the API-key on-boarding flow will not help; the request
  never reached the API. The fix is the headers.
- Add a row (or note) to the HTTP-error handling table for the CDN
  edge-block case so the agent recognises it: `403` with a Cloudflare
  `1010` body, or `curl`-works-but-script-fails, points at headers, not
  auth.
- Reference these headers in the "Putting it together" workflow's call
  step so an agent following the workflow as a checklist sets them.

#### Base URL and URL construction

The base URL is **`https://api.blockscout.com`**. There is no API version
prefix or other implicit path component — every operation path in the
OpenAPI spec is relative to this base.

**The full request URL is built by concatenating the base URL with the
operation's path string** taken verbatim from `references/pro-api.json`
(also reproduced in `references/pro-api-index.md`). After concatenation the
agent substitutes any `{templated}` segments (e.g. `{chain_id}`,
`{transaction_hash}`) with their actual values, then appends query
parameters from the operation's `parameters` schema.

Worked example — the index lists:

```
GET /{chain_id}/api/v2/blocks/{block_number_or_hash}
```

For chain `1` (Ethereum mainnet) and block `10000000`, the final URL is:

```
https://api.blockscout.com  +  /1/api/v2/blocks/10000000
=  https://api.blockscout.com/1/api/v2/blocks/10000000
```

The skill body must:

- State this concatenation rule explicitly and show at least one worked
  example like the one above.
- Take the path verbatim from the index — never invent, prefix, or rewrite
  it (no `/api/v2` prefixing, no inserting the host into the path, no
  guessing at chain placement).
- Resolve the path-template variables and query parameters by inspecting
  the endpoint's `parameters` definition via `oastools walk parameters`
  (see section C).

#### Authentication

The PRO API uses **a single authentication scheme for every endpoint**:
the API key is sent as a **Bearer token** in the `Authorization` request
header.

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.blockscout.com/1/api/v2/blocks/10000000' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer proapi_…'
```

The skill body must enforce these rules:

- **Always** authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer proapi_…`. This is
  the only authentication scheme the skill uses or refers to.
- Never log the API key, never embed it in a code snippet committed to a
  repo, and never echo it back to the user. Read it from an environment
  variable (e.g. `BLOCKSCOUT_PRO_API_KEY`) at runtime.

> **Do-not-advertise rule.** The skill body must **not** mention any
> alternative authentication form (e.g. an `apikey` query parameter, an
> `X-API-Key` header, basic auth, …) even to forbid it. Naming a
> forbidden alternative draws attention to it ("interesting — what does
> that mean?") and tempts an agent or a curious user to try it. State
> the Bearer-token form as *the* auth scheme and stop there. If a user
> independently discovers and asks the agent to use a different auth
> form, that is the user's choice and outside the skill's scope — but
> the skill itself must not document, illustrate, contrast, or warn
> against any other form.

#### Plans, credits, and per-call cost (queryable at runtime)

Two unauthenticated endpoints expose the live billing schema. Prefer them
over hard-coded numbers — pricing tiers and per-call credit costs change.

| URL | Returns | Auth |
|-----|---------|------|
| `https://api.blockscout.com/api/json/plans` | All plan tiers and their daily credit allowances / rate limits | None |
| `https://api.blockscout.com/api/json/config` | Per-endpoint credit cost table **and the list of supported chain IDs** | None |

For background context, the public docs currently advertise these tiers
(numbers are a snapshot — the agent should query `/api/json/plans` for
authoritative current values):

| Tier | Daily credits | Rate limit | Price |
|------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Free | 100,000 | 5 RPS | $0 |
| Standard | 100,000,000 | 15 RPS | $49/mo |
| Professional | 500,000,000 | 30 RPS | $199/mo |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Custom |

The skill body must instruct the agent to:

1. Call `/api/json/plans` and `/api/json/config` (no API key needed) when
   the user asks about pricing, plan limits, or how expensive a script will
   be to run.
2. Estimate script cost by multiplying expected call counts by per-call
   credit cost from `/api/json/config`.

#### Credit accounting on every response

Every PRO API call returns an **`x-credits-remaining`** response header
showing the credits left on the account after the call has been billed. The
skill body must:

- Read `x-credits-remaining` from each response in scripts that issue many
  calls and surface it to the user when it crosses meaningful thresholds
  (e.g. when remaining credits would not cover the rest of a planned batch).
- Treat falling/zero `x-credits-remaining` as a stop condition for batch
  scripts.

#### Rate limits and errors

- Per-plan **RPS limits** apply (see `/api/json/plans`). Scripts must
  throttle accordingly; on `HTTP 429` (rate-limited) the script should back
  off and retry, not retry tightly.
- On `HTTP 401`/`403` — invalid or missing API key. Surface clearly; do not
  retry.
- On `HTTP 402` or a body indicating credit exhaustion — the daily credit
  allowance is exceeded. Stop and report.
- On `HTTP 5xx` — transient; retry with backoff, capped attempts.

### B. Endpoint discovery — `references/pro-api-index.md`

The index file groups every endpoint by its OpenAPI tag (e.g. `transactions`,
`blocks`, chain-specific groups, `legacy`). Each entry has the form:

```
<METHOD> <path>: <short description>
```

The skill body must direct the agent to:

- **Always** consult `references/pro-api-index.md` first to pick a candidate
  endpoint.
- Use the path string from the index verbatim when querying the OpenAPI spec
  (`oastools` `-path` flag).

#### B.1 Prefer a direct endpoint over a derived chain of calls

The skill body must contain a **firm rule** (not a suggestion) that the
agent always scans the full index for a single purpose-built endpoint
**before writing any multi-step data-fetching logic**. The motivation is
that the PRO API frequently exposes one endpoint that answers the
question directly, replacing a chain of derived calls — which would
otherwise waste credits, multiply latency, and introduce off-by-one
bugs at each step.

The skill body must include this concrete worked example so the rule is
not abstract:

- Question: *"Find the block number that was current at Unix timestamp T."*
- Naive (must be flagged as wrong): binary-search
  `GET /{chain_id}/api/v2/blocks/{block_hash_or_number_param}` against
  block timestamps until convergence — dozens of calls and credits per
  resolution.
- Direct (must be flagged as the right approach): one call to the
  purpose-built legacy endpoint:
  ```
  GET /{chain_id}/api/legacy/block/get-block-number-by-time
  ```
  In its Etherscan-compatible legacy form, this is invoked as:
  ```
  GET /{chain_id}/api?module=block&action=getblocknobytime&timestamp=<T>&closest=before
  ```

The skill body must then generalise the lesson: whenever a request
decomposes into "fetch X, derive Y, aggregate Z", scan the index
broadly (including `legacy`) for an endpoint that returns Y or Z
directly; only fall back to a derived approach when no direct endpoint
exists.

#### B.2 Wedge 2 — Index-limits bridge: route contract-state requests to `eth_call`

The "always scan the index" rule (sections B and B.1) implicitly hides
the `eth_call` gateway: it is not in the index, so an agent obeying
that rule literally has nowhere to find it during endpoint discovery.
The skill body must add a bridge **inside the Endpoint discovery
section** that closes the gap **before** the agent could declare "no
match in the index" and **before** it could reach for an external RPC
URL.

The bridge must be placed immediately after the "scan the index" rule
(not later in the file) so the agent encounters it at the point of
decision. Concrete content the body should reproduce:

> **Index limits — recognise contract-state requests.** The index
> lists endpoints that return explorer-indexed data. It will **not**
> contain an endpoint for arbitrary contract state at a specific
> block — historical `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, view-function calls,
> contract storage reads. Those go through `eth_call` on the JSON-RPC
> gateway — same Bearer auth, same credit accounting. Recognise this
> case **before** declaring "no match in the index" and **before**
> considering an external RPC URL: there is no need for one.

### C. Endpoint detail lookup — `references/pro-api.json` via `oastools`

The OpenAPI document is large (~24,000 lines). **The skill body must instruct
the agent never to read `pro-api.json` whole.** Instead, query it with
`oastools` piped through `jq`.

#### Tooling note (must appear in the skill body)

The skill works best when `oastools` is installed locally. Installation
options (Homebrew, prebuilt binaries, `go install`, etc.) are documented at
https://github.com/erraggy/oastools/blob/main/README.md. `jq` is also
required.

> Flag style: the skill body must use **single-dash** flags (`-detail`,
> `-format`, `-method`, `-path`, `-name`, `-status`). Go's `flag` package
> accepts both `-x` and `--x`, but `oastools` help renders single-dash, so the
> skill should use that canonical form.

#### Canonical commands (must appear, verbatim or close to it)

The commands assume the working directory is the skill directory; otherwise
substitute the correct relative path to `pro-api.json`.

- **Full operation description** for an endpoint:
  ```
  oastools walk operations -detail -format json -path '<PATH>' references/pro-api.json \
    | jq '.operation.description'
  ```

- **Parameter specification** for an endpoint (drop the noisy `path` key):
  ```
  oastools walk parameters -detail -format json -method get -path '<PATH>' references/pro-api.json \
    | jq 'del(.path)'
  ```

- **Successful response (HTTP 200) format**:
  ```
  oastools walk responses -status 200 -detail -format json -method get -path '<PATH>' references/pro-api.json \
    | jq 'del(.path)'
  ```

- **Schema by name** — used to follow `$ref` pointers; the schema name is the
  last path segment of a `$ref` value (e.g. `Log` for
  `#/components/schemas/Log`):
  ```
  oastools walk schemas -detail -format json -name <SCHEMA_NAME> references/pro-api.json \
    | jq 'del(.jsonPath)'
  ```

#### Context-efficient traversal rules (must appear in the skill body)

1. **Do not pass `-resolve-refs`** to `oastools walk parameters`,
   `oastools walk responses`, or `oastools walk schemas`. Some endpoints have
   very deep schema dependency trees; resolving refs in one shot can dump
   hundreds of KB into the agent's context.

2. **Inspect `parameters` before calling an endpoint.** This is required to
   build the request correctly.

3. **Do not always inspect the full response schema.** The full schema tree is
   usually unnecessary. When the agent only needs to extract a few fields
   from the response, prefer **incremental traversal**: read the top-level
   response schema, then follow only the `$ref`s needed for the target fields
   by calling `oastools walk schemas -name <SCHEMA_NAME>` for each. This
   keeps context usage bounded.

4. Inspect the full schema tree only when the task genuinely requires it
   (e.g. building a typed client model).

### C.0 Reading contract state — `eth_call` via the JSON-RPC gateway

The skill body must include a short section noting that, while the
PRO API OpenAPI spec does not define contract-read methods, **`eth_call`
is available** through the PRO API's JSON-RPC gateway at:

```
POST https://api.blockscout.com/{chain_id}/json-rpc
```

The skill body must:

- State that the gateway uses the **same `Authorization: Bearer …`
  header** as every other PRO API call — credit accounting, rate
  limits, and key handling apply identically.
- Include one minimal `curl` example showing an `eth_call` request body.
- **Mention only `eth_call`.** Do not list, advertise, or illustrate any
  other JSON-RPC method (`eth_getBalance`, `eth_getLogs`,
  `eth_getTransactionByHash`, …) — naming them would compete with the
  REST endpoints from the index that already cover that data more
  efficiently.
- Explicitly steer the agent back to the indexed REST endpoints for any
  data the explorer has already indexed (balances, token holdings,
  transactions, logs, decoded events, contract metadata, NFT
  inventories, account abstraction objects, …) — the indexed REST path
  is invariably more efficient than synthesising the same data from
  RPC primitives.

The `eth_call` surface must be surfaced in three other places besides
this section, to prevent an agent from reading C.0 in isolation and
still skipping the gateway when planning a task. Those three structural
wedges live with the sections they modify:

- **Wedge 1 — introduction mention** → see section A,
  "What the PRO API is".
- **Wedge 2 — index-limits bridge** → see section B.2.
- **Wedge 3 — workflow routing fork** → see section D.1.

A regeneration that implements C.0 alone, without those three wedges,
will reproduce the observed failure mode in which an agent suggested
introducing an external `ETH_RPC_URL` for a historical-balance task.

### C.1 Pagination

The skill body must include a short section on pagination. The PRO API
paginates many list endpoints (`transactions`, `logs`, `token-transfers`,
holder lists, NFT inventories, block lists, …) and the cursor mechanism is
documented per-endpoint in the OpenAPI spec. The skill body must instruct
the agent to:

- Inspect the endpoint's response schema with `oastools walk responses`
  and look for the cursor field (typically `next_page_params`)
  **before** writing code that fetches a list.
- Pass the cursor back as query parameters on subsequent calls and loop
  until the cursor is empty or the user has enough data.
- Treat single-response (no-cursor) lists as already complete.
- Continue applying `x-credits-remaining` checks and plan-RPS throttling
  across the pagination loop, not just for the first page.

The skill body must NOT invent a generic pagination scheme — it must
defer to the per-endpoint cursor field discovered via `oastools`.

### C.2 Polling for change detection

The skill body must include a short polling-pattern section for the
"bot / monitor / indexer / watcher" use case. The PRO API is
request/response only — there is no webhook or websocket — so change
detection is built as a polling loop. The skill body must instruct the
agent to:

- Pick a **cadence** that keeps aggregate RPS under the plan limit (a
  single watcher every few seconds is usually fine on the free tier; a
  process running many watchers should share a token bucket).
- Persist a **high-water mark** between iterations: latest block number,
  latest transaction hash, latest log index, etc. — and fetch only what
  is newer than the marker on each pass.
- **Paginate forward from the marker** when the watcher has been
  offline and items accumulated, rather than re-fetching everything.
- Estimate the per-day credit cost up-front
  (`requests_per_day × per-call credits` from `/api/json/config`) and
  choose a poll interval that fits the plan budget.

### D. Calling the API

The skill body must show, at minimum:

- A `curl` example with the `Authorization: Bearer proapi_…` header (the
  only supported authentication form — see section A).
- A note that the exact path, parameter positioning, and `chain_id`
  placement for each endpoint comes from `references/pro-api-index.md` and
  `references/pro-api.json`. The skill must not generalise about path shape
  beyond what the index/spec say.
- **Resolving the `chain_id`.** Most PRO API endpoints require a `chain_id`.
  The list of supported chain IDs is published (alongside per-call credit
  costs) at `https://api.blockscout.com/api/json/config` (no API key
  required). The skill body must direct the agent to query this endpoint
  when it needs to confirm a chain is supported, or to look up the numeric
  chain ID for a chain the user named by symbol/name.
- A reminder to read `x-credits-remaining` from every response and surface it
  to the user when relevant (e.g. when running scripts that issue many
  calls).

#### D.0 Handling response verbosity

The skill body must include a short section on **response verbosity**.
PRO API responses are explorer-enriched and can be hundreds of KB —
the failure mode is an agent dumping a raw response into the
conversation (or letting it scroll through its own reading) and
exhausting the context window. The instruction itself must be brief
(the rule "save context" must not itself burn ~30 lines of the loaded
skill body). Concrete content the body should reproduce:

> **Handling response verbosity.** PRO API responses are
> explorer-enriched and can be hundreds of KB — a single
> transaction's logs, an enriched address page, a paginated list of
> token transfers. **Dumping a raw response into the agent's reading
> will exhaust the context window**, so apply the same "never read
> whole, project narrowly" discipline you apply to `pro-api.json`.
> Two recipes:
>
> - **You know what you need** → pipe `curl` through `jq` with the
>   smallest projection that satisfies the task:
>   `curl … | jq '{n: .height, t: .timestamp}'`. Drop heavy fields
>   you don't need (decoded calldata, NFT metadata, raw input bytes).
> - **You're exploring or debugging an unfamiliar response** →
>   first inspect the *schema* with `oastools walk responses` (zero
>   credits, bounded), or save the response to disk with
>   `curl -o /tmp/r.json` and probe it with `wc -c r.json`,
>   `jq 'keys'`, `jq '.items[0] | keys'`, or `head -c 1000` — never
>   `cat` the file or read it whole. Saving to disk lets you re-probe
>   without re-fetching, but the budget rule is unchanged: only
>   narrow projections reach the conversation.

The "Putting it together" workflow recap (D.1) must reference this
section in its call step so a checklist-driven agent applies the rule.

Rationale (notes for `skill-creator`, not for the skill body):

- The two recipes are deliberately narrower than a full response-
  transformation playbook (extract, filter, flatten, blob-handling,
  etc.). The agent's general engineering judgment covers the rest;
  prescribing every transformation pattern adds context weight without
  proportional benefit.
- The "save to disk" recipe is the right answer for the debug case
  because it avoids the credit cost of a probe-then-real pattern —
  one fetch, many local probes — while still preventing raw output
  from reaching the conversation.

#### D.1 Wedge 3 — "Putting it together" workflow recap with a routing fork

The skill body must close with a numbered workflow recap that an agent
can use as a checklist. The recap exists to surface every critical
decision at the point the agent makes it; without one, an agent may
read the file as a reference but never re-derive the sequence when
planning a task.

The recap must include, in order:

1. API key pre-flight (section A's registration rules).
2. Chain ID resolution (section D, `/api/json/config`).
3. **Routing fork — explorer-indexed data vs. contract state at a
   block.** This step is non-negotiable. It must explicitly ask
   whether the data need is for explorer-indexed data
   (transactions / balances / logs / blocks / tokens / NFTs / decoded
   events / contract metadata / account abstraction objects, …) — in
   which case the agent uses a REST endpoint from
   `references/pro-api-index.md` — or for **live or historical
   contract state at a specific block** (`balanceOf(addr)` at block
   `N`, `totalSupply()` at a past block, view-function calls, contract
   storage reads), in which case the agent uses `eth_call` via the
   JSON-RPC gateway. The step must instruct the agent **not** to
   introduce a separate RPC endpoint for the contract-state branch —
   the gateway is part of the PRO API and uses the same Bearer auth.
4. Endpoint lookup in `pro-api-index.md` (REST branch).
5. Parameter and response inspection via `oastools` (REST branch).
6. Call construction with the Bearer header, the
   [Required request headers](#required-request-headers-beyond-auth)
   (`User-Agent`, `Accept: application/json`), and reading
   `x-credits-remaining` from the response.
7. `eth_call` step: `POST` to
   `https://api.blockscout.com/{chain_id}/json-rpc` with the same
   Bearer auth and a JSON-RPC body (contract-state branch).
8. Long-running / batch concerns (rate-limit throttling, credit
   accounting, stop conditions).

The fork at step 3 is the single most important wedge: it ensures
that an agent following the workflow as a checklist cannot miss the
indexed-vs-contract-state choice. Without it, the workflow becomes
REST-only, and the `eth_call` surface gets detached from the planning
loop — which is exactly how the observed failure (an agent suggesting
an external `ETH_RPC_URL` for a historical-balance task) happened.

## Skill frontmatter — guidance for `skill-creator`

The frontmatter should mirror the conventions used by `blockscout-analysis`
(see `blockscout-analysis/SKILL.md`):

- `name: web3-dev`
- `description`: a one-paragraph string that triggers the skill whenever the
  user asks to build a web3/blockchain app, script, tool, or mobile/desktop
  client that needs blockchain data via the Blockscout PRO API. It should
  also trigger on direct mentions of "Blockscout PRO API", "pro-api",
  "Blockscout API", "block explorer API", "blockchain data", or
  requests for endpoint listings.
- `license: MIT`
- `metadata` JSON matching the existing skill convention (author, version,
  github, support).

The exact wording is left to `skill-creator`, but the description must be
specific enough that the agent picks the skill for both broad ("build a web3
app") and narrow ("call the PRO API endpoint for transaction logs") prompts.

---

## Out of scope for the skill body

- Submodule management, build pipelines, and the `pro-api-indexer.py`
  internals.
- Anything specific to the Blockscout MCP Server — that is owned by the
  `blockscout-analysis` skill.
- Web3 client library choice (ethers, viem, web3.py, …); the skill is
  transport-agnostic and only documents the PRO API itself.
